                <p>This random picture that my friend sent me by Slack is pretty close to my real face, but <b>who do I really am?</b></p>
                <p>I'm a product designer, specialized in design systems, who a few years ago worked for the dark side as a developer of mobile applications (mostly Android apps). </p>
                <p>I have participated in the construction of the Design System of the biggest retailer in Spain. I have also designed a few apps using the same design system I have built, and I have been part of the first design trainings within the company, since before our arrival there was not a single designer among its nearly 100,000 employees.</p>
                <p>Believe it or not, I am always curious and learning new things, even though I've been a designer for 3 years now, since summer 2022 I've started a UX/UI bootcamp at Ironhack and an online Master Degree in Design and Interaction. My new challenge is to cross the border and work on an international project. If you want to know more about me you can contact me through the section <a href="#ContactMe">Contact Me!</a>></p>
